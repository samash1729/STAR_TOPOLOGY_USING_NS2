The file in this repository is a TCL script which simulates a star topology.TCL script is used in NS2(Network Simulator Version 2) to simulate the live working of a network where packets can be seen moving from source to destination.
n0 is the central node.
Following are the edge connections :
n0-n1
n0-n2
n0-n3
n0-n4
n0-n5
n0-n6
n0-n7
n0-n8

Following are TCP connections in pairs of TCP_SOURCE-TCP_SINK respectively:
n0-n1 :tcp
n0-n2 :tcp1
n0-n3 :tcp2
n0-n4 :tcp3
n0-n5 :tcp4
n0-n6 :tcp5
n0-n7 :tcp6
n0-n8 :tcp7
